## Supported Operations
The connector supports the following operations:
* `Find`: A free text search designed for quick address queries
* `Postcode`: A search based on a property's postcode.
* `UPRN`: A search that takes a UPRN as the search parameter
* `Nearest`: Takes a pair of coordinates (X and Y) as an input to determine the closest address
