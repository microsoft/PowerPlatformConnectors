# WPForms by Reenhanced LLC
Use WPForms form submissions to trigger a flow or access any previous entry from within a flow. This connector brings WPForms to the Power Platform.

## Publisher: Reenhanced LLC
Reenhanced has built an API on top of WPForms designed to connect WPForms to the Power Platform.

## Prerequisites
WPForms pro is not required, but is highly recommended. The Power Automate for WPForms plugin requires a valid license for use. Purchase your license at reenhanced.com.

## Supported Operations

### Trigger: When a new WPForms entry is submitted
Send the complete entry to Power Automate. Your form fields are available as dynamic content for use in any additional action.

### Action: Get WPForms Entries
Get a list of entries from any WPForms form and use them in your flow. Each form field is available as a dynamic content item.

## Obtaining Credentials
To use this connector you need to install the Power Automate for WPForms plugin, available for purchase at reenhanced.com. When you install and activate the plugin, if you reload the Integration settings page you will see the three items required to connect your site to Power Automate:

1. *License Key:* This is your license key for the plugin
2. *Secret Key:* A randomly generated secret known only to your WordPress site and Power Automate
3. *Site URL:* This is the full url to access your WordPress site and is needed so Power Automate knows how to connect to your WordPress installation.

## Getting Started
Once you have installed the plugin and created a connection you can start an automated flow that is triggered by submission of a WPForms form.

## Known Issues and Limitations
At this time there is no way to modify entries within WPForms, but we are planning to build this.

## Deployment Instructions
This is a certified connector and can be used immediately, but you will need to install the WordPress plugin on any site that you wish to connect to Power Automate.
