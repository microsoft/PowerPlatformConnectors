Occuspace is the world's easiest Real-Time Crowd Analytics and Space Management solution. Our sensors identify Bluetooth and WiFi signals that then get filtered by our proprietary Machine Learning algorithm which returns the actual number of people in a space.
The Occuspace Connector provides you with RESTful interface to extract real-time and historical occupancy data for your Occuspace-enabled locations. It empowers business owners and managers to keep track of crowd levels in their spaces and learn from past trends and let people know when to expect busy times.
