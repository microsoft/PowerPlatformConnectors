## Obtaining Credentials
A request needs to be made to support@hivecpq.com requesting API credentials in the form of a username & password. 
In case of a custom installation you also need to request your own client ID and secret.

## Known Issues and Limitations
Query parameters which allow to pass a list of values will only have the first value respected by the underlying service. This is because of a conflict between the supported formats which powerautomate can use to send multi-value parameters and the format the underlying service accepts.


## Deployment Instructions
Please use [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/paconn-cli) to deploy this connector as custom connector in Microsoft Power Automate and Power Apps.

For custom connector installations please enter the correct client_id, which you need to request from HiveCPQ support, in the properties file of the connector.
