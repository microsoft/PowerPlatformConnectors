## Known Issues and Limitations
- The Revit element parameter values are represented in metric irrespective of the units specified on the source model.
- There is no localization support for parameter names currently. The built-in parameters will be available in English while the shared/project parameters will be available in the language used for their creation.
- Parameters of type Enumeration will currently only return the numeric value and not the string value.
- The **Get properties of a Data Exchange** action can return a maximum of 1024 dynamic parameter names. For exchanges that contain more than 1024 unique parameters, the list will be truncated to contain the top 1024 parameters.
- The **Get properties of a Data Exchange** action when used with the Latest properties option will not return records if only Type parameters have been changed. If the corresponding instance parameters have also been changed then both type parameters as well as instance parameters will be returned correctly.
- The **Get properties of a Data Exchange** action returns all the possible parameters within the selected Exchange. In some cases, there may be different parameters that have the same user-visible name. 
- Reference Parameters require an additional look up via the **Get details of a Data Exchange property** action to extract one or more fields from the referenced asset.
