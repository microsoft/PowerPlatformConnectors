Requires existing license to CobbleStone Software (Contact Insight).

## Supported Operations
### Get
Pull list of records for a given entity with specific criteria, order by tag, group by tag and number of records. Note: There is no limit on number of records to be pulled but the user has to consider that larger results will be slower to process.

### List of entities
Returns the list of names and three flagged properties indicating whether it can be edited, updated, or viewed/queried through this interface.

## Obtaining Credentials
Authorization (OAUTH 2.0)

- CobbleStone Software offers two methods of authorization for access: 
	- Authorization Code: https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/ 
	- Implicit Grant: https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/implicit/
		
Credentials can be setup/generated through your CobbleStone Software system.

## Getting Started
To create the API Client credentials through your CobbleStone Software system, use the following steps:

Within your CobbleStone Software system, a system administrator can navigate to the following page to setup/configure credentials:
- For SaaS Clients: https://yourCompanyName.cobblestone.software/core/MyAPI.aspx
- For Deployed Clients (typically): https://yourCompanyName/core/MyAPI.aspx

> (NOTE: This is under the "My" top menu item and then select "My API Clients")

> This allows a system admin to create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) for use with the connector.

From logging into your CobbleStone Software system:

To begin, you will open CobbleStone Software and go under My > My API Clientsâ€¦

Create a new API Client entry by clicking Add API Client and give it a unique name. The name is only internal and can be anything meaningful to its purpose.
We recommend using a different API key to organize things into small, manageable, and purposeful tasks.

This will generate a key and only admin personnel have access to the page. It is bound the the person who generated the key and they are the only one who can see it. You can share they key but only the logged in user can see it.

At this point we are done setting up the API Client entry. This Client ID and Client Securet are used for the connector to communicate with your CobbleStone Software system.

## Known Issues and Limitations
Currently the connector does not support sending or receiving binary files.

The "Update" endpoint is limited to a max of 500 affected rows per hit. If more then 500 records need to be updated, they need to be processed in multiple hits.
