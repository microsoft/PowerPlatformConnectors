## Obtaining Credentials

Access to Microsoft 365 Lighthouse is required to register this connector. Please refer to the [Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/lighthouse/m365-lighthouse-requirements?view=o365-worldwide) documentation regarding access requirements. This connector uses Microsoft Azure Active Directy Open Authentication and multifactor authentiation (MFA). During authorization, users must first select their Microsoft partner account that has a conditional access policy assigned to it that requires MFA for cloud apps. After authenticating via Azure Active Directory and completing MFA, a global admin must approve AAD permissions that will be used by the connector.

## Known Issues and Limitations

- Connector action is doesn't list all items: This occurs due to the nature of the Microsoft Graph API. You can increase the number of returned items by turning on pagination for that action and indicating the threshold of returned items. Use of $skipToken is not supported.
- This Connector is limited to the actions listed above. All other Microsoft 365 Lighthouse API endpoints are currently not supported. You can request additional features via the [Microsoft 365 Lighthouse Feedback Portal](https://feedbackportal.microsoft.com/feedback/forum/d6a21c42-fe1b-ec11-b6e7-0022481f8472)
