# Cloud BOT
Cloud BOT is a freemium service for web browser automation.

You can easily create your own robot with no code and no installation required.

Since the robot is located in the cloud, it can be run at any time.

As part of the flow, you can run a robot that automates browser operations.

You can pass the data/files to the robot and input it on the web, or receive the data/files acquired from the web and continue the flow.
