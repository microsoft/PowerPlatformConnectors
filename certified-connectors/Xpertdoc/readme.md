## Xpertdoc Connector

Xpertdoc enables business users to simplify, optimize and automate consistent document generation processes, leveraging Microsoft Dynamics 365 and external data sources as well as seamless integrations to leading applications. Our robust and user-friendly features let you easily create, generate, manage, store, deliver and e-sign business-critical documents like quotes, proposals, contracts, invoices and more without code.

## Pre-requisites

You need to have access to an Xpertdoc Smart Flows project. If you would like to get a free trial, simply click [here](https://www.xpertdoc.com/en/get-free-trial-document-generation/).

## How to get credentials

To obtain the API key from your project, you can follow [these instructions](https://kb.xpertdoc.com/display/UM/Using+the+API#UsingtheAPI-APIkeys). Once you have your API key, simply use the project URL (Ex: https://\[project\].smartflows.xpertdoc.com/) and the API key you generated when setting up the connection.

## Known issues and limitations

The current implementation of the connector only support executing flows that are connected to a Dynamics 365 or CDS environment. We will add more steps to do executions from other providers soon.
