## CRM Bot - Conversational AI for your CRM

Create a powerful conversational experience for your customers right from your CRM system. Give users new ways to interact with your company by building engaging voice and text-based conversational interfaces, such as voice apps and chatbots, powered by AI. Connect with users on your website, mobile app, the Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Facebook Messenger, and other popular platforms and devices. And do it directly from your existing CRM implementation.

## Prerequisites

Our clients have to undergo a registration process which is currently offered through MS Teams chatbot as well as part of overall solution installation, currently available through our sales bot [here](https://crmbot.ai). This provides them with a secret API key which is necessary to use our connector with their chatbot projects.

## How to get credentials

In order to get access to your own chatbot project with CRM Bot, all you have to do is get in touch with our CRM chatbot (which is available at crmbot.ai). The chatbot will guide you through the registration process.
