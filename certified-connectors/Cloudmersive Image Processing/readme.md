## Supported Operations
### Adaptively adjust the contrast of the image to be more appealing and easy to see	
Uses Gamma to adjust the contrast adaptively the way the human eye sees the world. Results significantly improve the viewability and visual appeal of the image.

### Add a customizeable drop shadow to an image	
Add a customizeable drop shadow to the image

### Compare and match faces	
Find the faces in an input image, and compare against a reference image to determine if there is a match against the face in the reference image. The reference image (second parameter) should contain exactly one face.

### Composite two images together	
Composites two input images together; a layered image onto a base image. The first image you input is the base image. The second image (the layered image) will be composited on top of this base image. Supports PNG transparency. To control padding you can include transparent pixels at the border(s) of your layered images as appropriate.

### Detect and unskew a photo of a document	
Detect and unskew a photo of a document (e.g. taken on a cell phone) into a perfectly square image. Great for document scanning applications; once unskewed, this image is perfect for converting to PDF using the Convert API or optical character recognition using the OCR API.

### Detect fine text in a photo of a document	
Identify the position, and size of small/fine text within a photograph of a document. Identify the location of small text in a photo - such as words and other forms of high density text. Can be used on a scan of a document or a photograph (e.g. smartphone camera) of a document, page or receipt. For OCR purposes - please see our Deep Learning OCR APIs.

### Detect large text in a photo	
Identify the position, and size of large text within a photograph. Identify the location of large text in a photo - such as signs, titles, etc. and other forms of large, low-density text. Not suitable for high-density text (e.g. scans of documents, receipts, etc.) for OCR purposes - for OCR, please see our Deep Learning OCR APIs.

### Detect objects including types and locations in an image	
Identify the position, size and description of objects in an image, along with a recognition confidence level. Detects both human people and objects in an image.

### Detect people including locations in an image	
Identify the position, and size of human people in an image, along with a recognition confidence level. People in the image do NOT need to be facing the camera; they can be facing away, edge-on, etc.

### Detect the age of people in an image	
Identify the age, position, and size of human faces in an image, along with a recognition confidence level. People in the image do NOT need to be facing the camera; they can be facing away, edge-on, etc.

### Detect the gender of people in an image	
Identify the gender, position, and size of human faces in an image, along with a recognition confidence level. People in the image should be facing the camera.

### Detect vehicle license plates in an image	
Identify the position, and size, and content of vehicle license plates in an image. License plates should be within 15-20 degrees on-axis to the camera.

Perform an emboss operation on the input image

### Find the location of a symbol in an image	
Determine if an image contains a symbol, and if so, the location of that symbol in the image.

### Normalizes image rotation and removes EXIF rotation data	
Automatically orients the input image based on EXIF information and then removes the EXIF information. EXIF is an additional set of information stored in some images taken with cell phone cameras based on the orientation of the camera. By normalizing rotation and removing EXIF data these images become much easier to process.

### Posterize the image by reducing distinct colors	
Reduce the unique number of colors in the image to the specified level

### Remove transparency from the image	
Removes any active transparency in the image. Effectively renders the image at the same resolution, in the same file format, over a white background, thus removing transparency.

### Resize an image	
Resize an image to a specific width and specific height

### Resize an image while preserving aspect ratio	
Resize an image to a maximum width and maximum height, while preserving the image's original aspect ratio

### Returns the dominant colors of the image	
Uses advanced image processing to extract the top 5 dominant colors in the image, returned in the order of dominance with the most-dominant color first. These are the primary perceptual colors used in the image as perceived by a viewer.

### Returns the image metadata including EXIF and resolution	
Returns the metadata information on the image, including file type, EXIF (if available), and resolution.

### Rotate an image any number of degrees	
Rotates an image by an arbitrary number of degrees

### Swirl distort the image	
Swirl distort the image by the specified number of degrees

### Transform an image into an artistic painting automatically	
Uses machine learning to automatically transform an image into an artistic painting. Due to depth of AI processing, depending on image size this operation can take up to 20 seconds.
