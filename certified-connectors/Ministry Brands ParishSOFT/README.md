# ParishSOFT Family Suite API
Ministry Brands ParishSOFT Family Suite is an integrated church management software solution that gives you access to everything you need for your ministry to run smoothly. Pastors, staff, and parish administrators can streamline the behind-the-scenes administrative work. Rather than having a different software or online platform for membership, online giving, communications, and volunteer management, Ministry Brands ParishSOFT Family Suite cohesively ties all the tasks into one system. This connector uses the Family Suite APIs to make it easy to interact with information captured using the Family Suite of applications. You can utilize various actions in the connector to easily extract data from Family Suite and integrate with other applications.
