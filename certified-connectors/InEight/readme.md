# InEight Connector
InEight Connector provides an API to work with InEight objects.

## Publisher: InEight

## Prerequisites
You will need the following to proceed:
* Access to the InEight Cloud platform
* An Azure subscription

## Using the connector
The InEight cloud platform APIs are secured by Azure Active Directory (AD) so, you first need to set up a user account with the required permissions in the cloud platform. This allows InEight connectors to access the InEight cloud platform securely.

### User account:
A valid user account is required to create a connection and use the InEight connector. Work with administrator to set up a user account to access the InEight cloud platform.

### Tenant Prefix:
This is part of the environment url.

Example:
- Environment url: [customer].hds.ineight.com
- Tenant Prefix: [customer]

### Ocp-Apim Subscription Key:
Work with an administrator to get subscription key.
