# RiskIQ PassiveTotal

RiskIQ PassiveTotal aggregates data from the whole internet, absorbing intelligence to identify threats and attacker infrastructure, and leverages machine learning to scale threat hunting and response. With PassiveTotal, you get context on who is attacking you, their tools and systems, and indicators of compromise outside the firewallâ€”enterprise and third party.
