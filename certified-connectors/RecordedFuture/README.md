The Recorded Future integration allows real-time security intelligence to be integrated into popular Microsoft services like Sentinel, Defender ATP, and others. This empowers our clients to maximize their existing security investments, ensuring they have real-time intelligence to secure their cloud environments and reduce risk to the organization. The Recorded Future connector for Microsoft Azure enables access to dedicated actions for pulling Recorded Future indicators (IP, Domain, URL, Hash, Vulnerabilities), associated context (Risk Score, Risk Rules, Intelligence Card Link and Related Entities), and Recorded Future alerts.
