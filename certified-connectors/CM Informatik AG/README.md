# CMI
For low-code based data exchange: Transfer given information from M365 directly into CMI.
Transfer your data based on CMI dossier, including tasks and contacts, from M365 to the CMI solution. The CMI Custom Connector enables even more collaboration from both worlds. Their strengths combined into an unbeatable combination. With our basic functionality you can make use of almost every M365 app to create new or update given objects in your CMI solution.
