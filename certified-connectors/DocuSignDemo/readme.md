# Title
DocuSign helps organizations connect and automate how they prepare, sign, act on, and manage agreements. The DocuSign Demo connector connects only to DocuSign Demo environments but offers the same functionality as the regular DocuSign connector. Any documents in a DocuSign Demo environment are not legally binding. For all non-demo uses, use the regular DocuSign connector.

## Prerequisites
To use the Connect trigger in this integration, DocuSign Connect must be enabled in your DocuSign account. It is not enabled by default. Once enabled, the Connect Settings page can be accessed from the DocuSign Admin web application. Using the Connect trigger in this integration will automatically register the webhook for you.

## Obtaining Credentials
To try the connector, please use a DEMO account:
  - Go to https://developers.docusign.com/
  - Create Sandbox account.

These are different than free trials in that they never expire, have 90% of our paid account features, and none of the documents sent through DEMO are legally binding ((https://support.docusign.com/en/articles/Free-account-vs-Developer-account).
