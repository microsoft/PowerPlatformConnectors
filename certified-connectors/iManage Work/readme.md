# iManage Work

iManage is the industry-leading provider of document and email management solutions for knowledge workers. iManage platform organizes and secures the information in documents and emails, so professionals can search for what they need, act on it, and collaborate more effectively. The iManage Work connector enables users to automate repetitive tasks and approval processes while they keep all their files secure in the iManage Work environment.

## Publisher: iManage LLC

## Prerequisites

The connector is available for all iManage Work customers connecting to cloudimanage.com. First, the Power Automate application will need to be enabled by an administrator of your iManage Work environment. Once enabled, you will need the specific URL for your environment and a login account and password under which the connector can execute actions. For more information, see the FAQ.

## Supported Triggers

### For a selected document

This trigger allows you to start a workflow for a selected document in iManage Work. Provide a display name that will be shown to users in iManage Work applications. If 'Wait For Completion' is set to 'Yes', you must use the 'Update workflow state' action in your workflow, otherwise applications will eventually time out without indicating the completion state to the user.

### For multiple selected documents

This trigger allows you to start a workflow for two or more selected documents in iManage Work. Provide a display name that will be shown to users in iManage Work applications. If 'Wait For Completion' is set to 'Yes', you must use the 'Update workflow state' action in your workflow, otherwise applications will eventually time out without indicating the completion state to the user.
