## Supported Operations
The connector supports the following operations:
* `Send a Teams notification`: Send a notification to users in a Microsoft Teams chat by using Pling. You select a template to use for your message. Edit templates in the Pling app in Microsoft Teams. Pling must already be installed on your tenant. Individual users who receive a Pling message will get Pling automatically installed if they do not have it already.
* `Get profiles`: Get a list of available profiles in your Pling app. This action is usually not needed but it is made available here for advanced purposes. A profile indicates an isolated instance of Pling and is a good way to separate Pling messages based on different legal entities in the same tenant.
* `Get templates`: Get a list of available templates in your Pling app. Each template is an Adaptive Card that is managed inside the Pling app in Microsoft Teams.
