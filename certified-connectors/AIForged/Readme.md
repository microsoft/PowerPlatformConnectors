# AIForged
AIForged is an Intelligent Document Processing solution to complex document extraction problems.
You can train your AIForged project to combine cognative services in order to classify and extract important information from documents.  AIForged can automate the processing and extraction of structured data from unstructured images.
The AIForged connector is based on the [AIForged REST API](https://local.aiforged.com/swagger/index.html?urls.primaryName=swagger.v1.0).  The connector allows automation and integration with AIForged.

## Prerequisites
