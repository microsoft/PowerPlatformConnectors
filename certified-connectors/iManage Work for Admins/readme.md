# iManage Work for Admins

iManage is the industry-leading provider of document and email management solutions for knowledge workers. iManage platform organizes and secures the information in documents and emails, so professionals can search for what they need, act on it, and collaborate more effectively. The iManage Work connector for Admins supports automation of iManage Administrator features that are available in Control Center. For example, updating metadata fields, adding users, and so on.

## Publisher: iManage LLC

## Prerequisites

The connector is available for all iManage Work customers connecting to cloudimanage.com. First, the iManage Work Admin for Power Automate application will need to be enabled by an administrator of your iManage Work environment. Once enabled, you will need the specific URL for your environment and a login account and password under which the connector can execute actions. Actions respect the same permissions as applied in Work, so for many of these actions you must have NRT Admin or Tier 1 or Tier 2 support. For more information see the FAQ.
