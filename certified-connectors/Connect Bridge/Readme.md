## Connect Bridge
Connect Bridge is a software integration platform that allows you to build your custom integration software in any language with much fewer lines of code. Connect Bridge uses its connectors to translate SQL statements into API calls.


## Prerequisites
You will need the following to proceed:
* On-premises data gateway
* An active Connect Bridge installation on a machine inside your network
* Purchase of a Connect Bridge license and the connectors of your choice
* The connectors are setup as Accounts inside the Connect Bridge Management Studio


## Supported Operations
The connector supports the following operations:
* `Create connection`: Establish a connection with an Account
* `Close connection`: Closes a previously created connection by the `Create connection` operation
* `Execute SQL query`: Executes a SQL statement
* `Format SQL query result`: Transforms the SQL result from the `Execute SQL query` operation making it easier to work with


## Known issues and limitations
