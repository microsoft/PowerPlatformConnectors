#DocJuris

DocJuris is a contract negotiation workspace that empowers legal and business teams to close deals with speed and accuracy.
Legal, sales, and procurement organizations love DocJuris because it improves collaboration, saves time, and decreases risk during
the contract redlining and markup process.

The DocJuris Connector can be used to:

- Upload new documents as contracts, turns, or imports (Imports can be easily turned into contracts or turns inside the DocJuris app)
- Retrieve details about contracts or turns
- Get notified when turns are created or completed

To use the connector, you must have an active subscription to DocJuris. Follow the instructions here to set up connection information:
