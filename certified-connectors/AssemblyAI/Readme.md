With the [AssemblyAI](https://www.assemblyai.com) Connector, you can use AssemblyAI's models to process audio data by transcribing it with speech recognition models, analyzing it with audio intelligence models, and building generative features on top of it with LLMs.

## Publisher: AssemblyAI

## Prerequisites
You will need the following to proceed:
* An AssemblyAI API key ([get one for free](https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard))


## Supported Operations
The connector supports the following operations:

### Upload a File
Upload your media file directly to the AssemblyAI API if it isn't accessible via a URL already.

### Transcribe Audio
Create a transcript from an audio or video file that is accessible via a URL.

### List transcripts
Retrieve a list of transcripts you created.
Transcripts are sorted from newest to oldest.
The previous URL always points to a page with older transcripts.

### Get Transcript
Get the transcript resource. The transcript is ready when the "status" is "completed".

### Delete Transcript
Delete the transcript.
Deleting does not delete the resource itself, but removes the data from the resource and marks it as deleted.

### Get Subtitles of Transcript
Export your transcript in SRT or VTT format, to be plugged into a video player for subtitles and closed captions.

### Get Sentences of Transcript
Get the transcript split by sentences.
The API will attempt to semantically segment the transcript into sentences to create more reader-friendly transcripts.

### Get Paragraphs of Transcript
Get the transcript split by paragraphs.
The API will attempt to semantically segment your transcript into paragraphs to create more reader-friendly transcripts.

### Search Transcript for Words
Search through the transcript for a specific set of keywords.
You can search for individual words, numbers, or phrases containing up to five words or numbers.

### Get Redacted Audio
Retrieve the redacted audio object containing the status and URL to the redacted audio.

### Run a Task using LeMUR
Use the LeMUR task endpoint to input your own LLM prompt.

### Purge LeMUR Request Data
Delete the data for a previously submitted LeMUR request.
The LLM response data, as well as any context provided in the original request will be removed.
