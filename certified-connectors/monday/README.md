### Obtaining Credentials
You need an active monday.com account. You also need to have installed the Microsoft Power Automate app in monday.com and signed up for a subscription to it.

Once this has been done, sign in to the monday connector in Power Automate. This will authenticate your connection between monday.com and Power Automate to allow you to start using the connector.

### Getting Started
1. In monday.com, search the marketplace for the Microsoft Power Automate app and add the app to your account.
2. If desired, add the Power Automate App Usage board view. The Power Automate App Usage view can be used to track the number of executions for each trigger/action for this connector to help avoid reaching your subscription limit.
3. In Power Automate, search for the "monday" connector for an action or a trigger.
4. After adding the monday action/trigger, sign in and authorize the app to start using it.

## App Usage
The Microsoft Power Automate app installed from the monday.com marketplace contains a Power Automate App Usage view. This view can be added to a board to track the number of executions of each trigger/action per month. It's useful to make sure you don't exceed your subscription limits. If you need more executions than your subscription currently allows, the board also contains a button to upgrade your plan to a higher tier.

## Frequently Asked Questions
### I uninstalled the Microsoft Power Automate app in monday.com and reinstalled it again. Now it is no longer working and I'm unable to successfully execute actions/triggers in the monday connector. How do I fix the connector?
When the Microsoft Power Automate app is uninstalled and reinstalled, the credentials are reset. To fix the connector, you need to re-authenticate your monday connector in Power Automate.

This can be done by going to Data -> Connections in the Power Automate sidebar. Then find the "monday" connection and click on it. At the top, click the "Switch account" button. This brings up a popup to re-authenticate your connection between monday.com and Power Automate. Click the Authorize button at the bottom of the popup. Your connection should now be restored and your actions/triggers should work again.

### I'm seeing a "Not Authenticated" error when executing a monday action/trigger in Power Automate and my actions/triggers have stopped working. How can I fix this?
This can occur when your connection between monday.com and Power Automate has been invalidated. One way this can occur is by uninstalling the Microsoft Power Automate app in monday.com.

To fix this issue, go to Data -> Connections in the Power Automate sidebar. Then find the "monday" connection and click on it. At the top, click the "Switch account" button. This brings up a popup to re-authenticate your connection between monday.com and Power Automate. Click the Authorize button at the bottom of the popup. Your connection should now be restored and your actions/triggers should now work again.

### When executing a monday action/trigger in Power Automate, it does not work. I see the error "Your monday.com Power Automate app is over the execution limit. If you need more executions, please purchase a higher plan for the Microsoft Power Automate app in monday.com". How do I fix this?
This occurs when you've used all the executions your Microsoft Power Automate subscription plan in monday.com currently supports. When this happens, actions/triggers will fail to execute until the next month, unless a higher level subscription is purchased.

If you need more executions, you can purchase a higher level subscription to the Microsoft Power Automate app in monday.com. Once you've done so, your actions/triggers should start working again within 5 minutes.
