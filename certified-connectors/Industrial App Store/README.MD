Intelligent Plant’s [Industrial App Store](https://appstore.intelligentplant.com) Microsoft Automate (Flow) Connector enables Microsoft’s powerful analytics and visualizations to be applied to real-time and historical process data. Seamlessly integrate plant and corporate data and share with any colleague on any device, enabling faster, better, real-time decision making. The Industrial App Store Connector connects to Intelligent Plant’s Industrial App Store, while all data **remains** secure and safe on-premises. The plant data may be centralized in a corporate data lake or globally dispersed across many sites and historians. Either way, Industrial App Store Power Automate Connector brings it all together and delivers to your fingertips.

## Industrial App Store - What is it

Intelligent Plant developed the Industrial App Store which enables interaction with all the different historian data through a unified API. At start of May 2020 Intelligent Plant released an official, Microsoft certified Industrial App Store connector for Power Automate. No more hefty SQL queries or Excel document interrogations with no easy real-time update option or complicated architecture solutions, simply install Industrial App Store connect and out of the box you will be able to connect to Aspentech IP.21, OSIsoft PI, Honeywell Dynamo, OPC DA & HDA, Siemens and many more. This allows our customers to bring data from various sources into Microsoft Automate flows to deliver insights that weren’t possible before. Real-time updates prompt money-saving decisions by engineers that also increase plant safety and efficiency.

### Prerequisites

* You will need App Store Connect to connect to you own data but its not essential if you wish to play around with demo data provided by Intelligent Plant. More info on how to connect your data to Industrial App Store can be found [here](https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Community-Blog/Connecting-industrial-historians-to-Microsoft-Power-BI-One/ba-p/942200 "Connecting industrial historians to Microsoft Power BI. One connector to get them all… ") and [here](https://appstore.intelligentplant.com/wiki/doku.php?id=app_store_connect:app_store_connect "Industrial App Store Wiki").

* Any kind of Microsoft Power Automate (Flow) subscription is needed in order to create Flows. More info on subscription types can be found [here](http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/5/6/9568EFD0-403D-4AE4-95F0-7FACA2CCB2E4/PowerApps%20and%20Flow%20Licensing%20Guide%20-%20August.pdf).

### Obtaining credentials

More information for new Industrial App Store users can be found [here](https://appstore.intelligentplant.com/wiki/doku.php?id=general:app_store_users "Intelligent Plant Industrial App Store wiki - Welcome to the Industrial App Store").

### Supported actions (operations)

Additional information on API calls made and its parameters can be found [here](https://appstore.intelligentplant.com/apihelp "Intelligent Plant Industrial App Store wiki - API help").

* **Get snapshot**

## Supported triggers

Coming soon. A workaround at the moment would be to schedule a fequent task.

## Known limitations

* Users can only query for a single tag per action. This means if you wish to query two or more tags you'll have to define multiple actions of the same type. This is due to Microsoft not supporting 'explosive arrays' in swagger definition. We are currently working on new API endpoints to support this.
