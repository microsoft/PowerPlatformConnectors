## Pre-requisites
You will need the following to use the Motimate connector:
* A subdomain to motimateapp.com
* An admin account to your organization
* A ClientID to the Motimate API

## Using the Motimate Connector

### Shared input parameters
Certain parameters are shared across most, if not all, tasks available in the Motimate connector. These are:
* `Subdomain`: This is your organization's subdomain to motimateapp.com. If your organization uses 'example.motimateapp.com' to log in to Motimate, the subdomain would be 'example'. The parameter is required for all operations in order to route your request to the correct organization's API.
* `Auth`: This parameter is required for all operations except the 'POST Token' operation. Use 'Bearer ' + the 'access_token' output from the 'POST Token' in all subsequent operations in order to authenticate your request to the API.

### Authentication
The first Motimate operation in any given flow must be acquiring an access token from the 'POST Token' operation. Acquiring the token only needs to be done once per flow. After you acquire the token, you pass the value 'Bearer ' along with the token in all subsequent Motimate operations.
