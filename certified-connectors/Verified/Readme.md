## Obtaining Credentials
This connector uses Basic Authentication. The user has to present username, password and company ID when creating a connection. Username and password are the same you use to login to the Verified portal.
To get the company Id you have to log in to the Verified portal, select the correct company if you have several and copy the company Id from the URL.

## Known Issues and Limitations
The following limitations are currently known.
- In the beginngin of every flow one has to create an authentication token to be reused in every following step.
- To add a document one has to send a HTTP request to a certain url.

## Good to know
There are a few things in how the Verified API works and answers that need some extra handling in Power Automate.

### Get Envelop Id
The steps that create an envelop respond with an uid, which is a complete path to the envelop (example: "/envelopes/ABCDE"). For other steps one does only need the last part of the uid (which is the actual envelop Id, in our example "ABCDE"). 

Here is an example on how to do that

```
substring(outputs('Create_new_default_envelope')?['body/uid'],11)
```

### Get Document Id
The steps that create a document respond with the Location of the new document in the header. The Location is the complete path to the document (example: "/api/envelopes/ABCDE/documents/FGHIJ"). Only the document Id (in our case: FGHIJ) is needed for following steps.

Here is an example on how to do that

```
substring(outputs('Add_document_to_envelope')?['headers/Location'], add(indexOf(outputs('Add_document_to_envelope')?['headers/Location'], '/documents/'), 11))
```

### Get Flow Id
When one loads information about an envelope the related flow will be part of the response (example: "/flow/default"). In the response it is called the id of a flow, however one needs only the last part when another step (like Get flow status) is asking for the flow id.

Here is an example on how to do that

```
substring(outputs('Get_envelope_by_id')?['body/flow/id'],6)
```

### Upload Document
To Upload an actuall document you have to create a file in the Verified API and upload the document hash to the blob URL responded from the Verified API.
