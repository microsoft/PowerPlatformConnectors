# Rencore Code

Discover issues in your SharePoint applications and fix them before they become a problem.

You extend SharePoint and Office 365 to collaborate effectively. But the applications you build, from a piece of JavaScript embedded on SharePoint pages to complete SharePoint Framework solutions, expose your organization to risks. Using Rencore Code you can analyze your SharePoint applications for any issues and resolve them before they become a problem.

If you have an existing Rencore Code license, you can enter it in the connector to get more detailed results. To obtain a license, contact us at [rencore.com/contact](https://rencore.com/contact/).
