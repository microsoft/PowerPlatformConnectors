The Zanran Scaffolder server provides a web API which enables users to automatically extract content from PDFs and images. It is designed primarily for extracting from reports (annual accounts, scientific papers, market reports, etc.) Zanran's Scaffolder engine automatically determines the structure and layout of these documents and extracts content into constituent parts: blocks of text (e.g. paragraphs); tables; and images/graphics. It uses Computer Vision and Machine Learning and outputs data in structured formats like Excel and XML. It is scalable and does not require any manual intervention or pre-defined templates, any training or configuration. The software is language agnostic and it is built for automation / RPA environments to process millions of files.

## Prerequisites

## Known issues and limitations

We recommend testing using 'native' PDFs, rather than scanned ones - to remove any effects of OCR.
