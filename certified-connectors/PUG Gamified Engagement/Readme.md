## Getting started with your connector
 
PUG Gamified Engagement gives some type of gamification outcome when some action or set of actions has been undertaken by a user. These actions are called "triggers" in Picnic™. The "logic" that is used to express when outcomes occur is specified in a Rule. Triggers for actions can be any type of action that is undertaken in a 3rd party system, while Outcomes can be badges, currency, virtual goods.
 
Using the Connector involves:
1. Determining your business objectives and what types of actions your customers, audience members, and learners will help you reach these objectives.
2. Designing which gamification techniques will best work for your user base, and how these will be integrated into your site or application. More information on how to do this is available from PUG Interactive.
3. Using the Picnic™ Customer Engagement Hub Campaign Manager, set up rules and outcomes.
4. Integrate the specific features into your app by using the PUG Gamified Engagement Connector for Dynamics 365.
