# BuildingMinds DigitalTwin Core Connector
BuildingMinds Core provides various REST APIs. With this API you can access the Digital Building Twin Masterdata API on the BuildingMinds Platform. A problem many customers have in the real estate sector is accurate information about their buildings. With the API customers and partners can use and create Apps which build on the Digital Building Twin.
