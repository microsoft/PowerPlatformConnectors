FORCAM FORCE Bridge is the first IIoT-Platform with out of the box MESA-Applications. The FORCAM FORCE Bridge Connector provides the ability to build workflows wich supports the daily life in manufacturing. For example it is possible to build a flow wich sends a notification if a machine stoppes or a key figure (e.g Overall Equipment Effectiveness) falls below a limit.

## Prerequisites

To use the Connector you need a valid FORCAM FORCE installation (SaaS, PaaS or On-Prem) including the Bridge API modul with Version 3 or higher. Your technical consultant is able to connect your instance with our Gateway-Service. This service is the bridge between your FORCE-Instance and Power Automate.
