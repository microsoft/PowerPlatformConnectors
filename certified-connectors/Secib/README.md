# SECIB

SECIB provides a REST API which can be used to manage your SECIB's data (such as your case files, your calendar, your documents, etc).

The SECIB connector uses that REST API to allow SECIB's users to automate their workflow. For instance, you can trigger a worklflow when a new case file is created in SECIB neo and then process this case file before sending an email notification with the case file's information to other SECIB's users.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following to proceed :

- A Microsoft Power Apps or Microsoft Power Automate plan enabling the use of Premium connectors
- A SECIB neo/air or a Gestisoft licence. Please go to <https://www.secib.fr/> for further information.
