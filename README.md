# Microsoft Power Platform Connectors

Welcome to the Microsoft Power Platform Connectors open source repository. This repository contains custom connectors, certified connectors, and related tools to facilitate connector development for Azure Logic Apps, Microsoft Power Apps, and Microsoft Power Automate.

## Custom Connectors

The ```custom-connectors``` folder contains fully functional connector samples which can be deployed to the Power Platform for extension and use. These samples may not be certified connectors, but should be maintained by the open source community to offer useful scenarios or examples of connector concepts.

## Certified Connectors

The ```certified-connectors``` folder contains certified connectors which are already deployed and available out-of-box within the Power Platform for use. 
A requirement of our [connector certification program](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/custom-connectors/submit-certification) is that new certified connectors be open sourced for community contributions. 
The ```certified-connectors``` folder is managed by the Microsoft Connector Certification Team to ensure that within the ```master``` branch, the connector version is identical to that deployed in the Power Platform. 
The ```dev``` branch is maintained by the connector owner and the Microsoft Connector Certification Team to allow community development of the connector prior to certification and deployment of a version. 

## Independent Publisher Connectors

The ```independent-publisher-connectors``` folder contains connectors that are submitted by publishers that do not own the underlying service behind their connector. Anyone can submit a new connector to this folder, add functionality to connectors in this folder, and resolve issues related to the connectors in this folder. The folder is managed by the Independent Publisher Connector Community, which includes Independent Publishers and Project Coordinators. The master branch is maintained by the Microsoft Connector Certification Team, who ensures that the connector version is identical to that deployed in the Power Platform. The dev branch is maintained by the connector maintainer(s) and the Microsoft Connector Certification Team to allow community development of the connector prior to certification and deployment of a version.

### Files to Include
Please submit the following files: An Open API swagger definition, an API properties file, and a README.md.

### API Definition (Swagger) File

The API definition, also known as the swagger, describes the API for the custom connector using the OpenAPI specification.

### API Properties File

The API properties file contains some properties for the custom connector. These properties are not part of the API definition. It contains information such as the brand color, authentication information, etc. A typical API properties file looks like the following:

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "capabilities": [],
    "connectionParameters": {
      "api_key": {
        "type": "securestring",
        "uiDefinition": {
          "constraints": {
            "clearText": false,
            "required": "true",
            "tabIndex": 2
          },
          "description": "The KEY for this API",
          "displayName": "KEY",
          "tooltip": "Provide your KEY"
        }
      }
    },
    "iconBrandColor": "#007EE6",
    "policyTemplateInstances": [
      {
        "title": "MyPolicy",
        "templateId": "setqueryparameter",
        "parameters": {
            "x-ms-apimTemplateParameter.name": "queryParameterName",
            "x-ms-apimTemplateParameter.value": "queryParameterValue",
            "x-ms-apimTemplateParameter.existsAction": "override"
        }
      }
    ]    
  }
}
```

More information on the each of the properties are given below:

* `properties`: The container for the information.

* `connectionParameters`: Defines the connection parameter for the service.

* `iconBrandColor`: The icon brand color in HTML hex code for the custom connector.

* `capabilities`: Describes the capabilities for the connector, e.g. cloud only, on-prem gateway etc.

* `policyTemplateInstances`: An optional list of policy template instances and values used in the custom connector.

### README.md

README.md file for your connector includes a description for your connector, any prerequisite a developer or contributor may need to build your connector. It includes instructions on how to use your connector and api, how to get credentials, supported operations, known issues and limitations, etc. This file is meant to be a standalone guide for deploying and using your connector by other users and developers. A sample can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPlatformConnectors/blob/dev/custom-connectors/AzureKeyVault/Readme.md).

### Submitting to the Open Source Repository

Contributions to the open source repository are made through pull requests. 
Prior to submitting a pull request, ensure that your pull request does not contain any sensitive or specific information, for example Client IDs or Client Secrets. 
Any sensitive values can be replaced with fake or dummy values for the purposes of submission as long as it is clearly indicated. 
Also, ensure that the readme.md of the connector is updated with the latest information, or created for new connector submissions. 
An example of a clear, structured, readme.md can be found in the [Azure Key Vault](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPlatformConnectors/blob/dev/custom-connectors/AzureKeyVault/Readme.md) connector repository. 
Include this completed `readme.md` in same connector directory which contains the artifacts. 

Add tags indicating which connector type you are submitting. Connector type name should match the folder name you are submitting to: custom-connector, certified-connector, or independent-publisher-connector.

#### Certified Connectors

For new connectors which will be submitted for certification, create a directory under the ```certified-connectors``` directory, place the connector files in the sub-folder, and submit a pull request to the ```dev``` branch. Ensure that a clear, structured, readme.md is included. 

Add a tag by selecting the labels option to "certified-connector"

Updates to certified connectors must first be made through a pull request to the ```dev``` branch for review by the connector owner. 

Once a pull request has been merged to the ```dev``` branch, the connector owner can submit the connector for certification through the Connector certification tab in [ISV Studio](https://isvstudio.powerapps.com). Once certified, the Microsoft Certification team will handle merging the updates from ```dev``` to ```master```. 

Updates to an existing custom connector can be made through a simple pull request to the ```dev``` branch to update the custom connector files.

#### Independent Publisher

Follow the same instructions as above on submitting for certification, create a directory under the custom-connector directory and place the connector files in the sub-folder. 
Add a tag by selecting the labels option to "independent-publisher-connector". 

#### Custom Connector

Follow the same instructions on submitting for certification, create a directory under the independent-publisher-connectors directory and place the connector files in the sub-folder. Add a tag by selecting the labels option to "custom-connector".

### Tooling and Validation

#### CLA

When a pull request is submitted, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide
a CLA and annotate the PR appropriately. Simply follow the instructions
provided by the bot to ensure your pull request can be properly reviewed.
You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.

This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).
For more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or
contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.

#### Swagger Validation

A submitted pull request will also be validated against our Swagger Validator tool, which checks the connector files to ensure it is a proper Swagger file and adheres to our connector requirements and guidelines. Any errors or warnings will be added to the PR for both the submitter and the reviewer to understand. We do not accept pull requests with outstanding unresolved Swagger Validator issues. 

#### Breaking Change Detector

Another validation which runs on a submitted pull request is the breaking changes validator. This is to catch any inadvertent, non-backwards-compatible (i.e. breaking) changes which may break a current user experience, for example, deleting a published operation. The Breaking Change Detector compares the previous version of the Swagger with the new submission and raises awareness of any breaking change. The submitter and reviewer must both acknowledge any breaking changes submitted and ensure that no end users are inadvertently negatively affected.
