# Microsoft Power Platform Connectors

Welcome to the Microsoft Power Platform Connectors open source repository. This open source repository contains custom connectors, certified connectors, and related tools to facilitate connector development for Azure Logic Apps, Microsoft Power Apps, and Microsoft Power Automate.

## Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions.  Most contributions require you to agree to a
Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us
the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://cla.microsoft.com.

To contibute a connector to the open source repo, please start by creating a fork on the github repo.
Once you have the fork created, create a new branch on the forked repo. Clone this forked repo on you 
local machine, and checkout the branch. Create a folder for your connector under the `connectors` folder
and place the connector files in the sub-folder. Ensure that you have removed any sensitive information, such as Client IDs, from your artifacts before continuing. Any sensitive information can be replaced with fake values for the purpose of your submission.

Next, create a `readme.md` for your connector. An example can be found in the [Azure Key Vault](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPlatformConnectors/tree/master/samples/AzureKeyVault) connector repository. Include this completed `readme.md` in your connector's folder which contains your artifacts. 

Once complete, commit and push the changes to your forked branch. Create a pull request from the forked branch to the main repo to merge your changes into the main repo.
[Please see this document for more information](https://github.com/CoolProp/CoolProp/wiki/Contributing:-git-development-workflow).

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide
a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the instructions
provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.
