When submitting a connector, please check the following conditions for your PR to ensure a smooth certification process.

- [ ] I attest that the connector works and I verified by deploying and testing all the operations.
- [ ] I attest that I have added detailed descriptions for all operations and parameters in the swagger file.
- [ ] I validated the swagger file, `apiDefinition.swagger.json`, by running `paconn validate` command.
- [ ] If this is a certified connector, I confirm that `apiProperties.json` has a valid brand color and doesn't use an invalid brand color, `#007ee5` or `#ffffff`. If this is an independent publisher connector, I confirm that I am not submitting a connector icon.
