Identity Protection is a tool that allows organizations to discover, investigate, and remediate identity-based risks in their environment.
This connector will leverage the riskyUsers, riskDetections, and signIns APIs.


## Pre-requisites

Azure AD Identity Protection is a premium feature. You need an Azure AD Premium P1 or P2 license to access the riskDetection API (note: P1 licenses receive limited risk information). The riskyUsers API is only available to Azure AD Premium P2 licenses only.
