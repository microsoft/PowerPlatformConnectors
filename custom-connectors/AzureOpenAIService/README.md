# Azure OpenAI Service

Azure OpenAI Service Connector for Power Platform & Azure Logic Apps.

> This is a connector based on the [OpenAI Independent Publisher connector](https://learn.microsoft.com/connectors/openaiip/) built by [Robin Rosegr√ºn](https://linktr.ee/r2power). It has some extra actions, because that's how Azure OpenAI Service works.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following to proceed:
* A Microsoft Power Apps or Power Automate plan with custom connector feature
* An Azure subscription and access to Azure OpenAI Service (currently in preview)
* The Power Platform Connectors CLI (Paconn CLI) tools ([link](https://learn.microsoft.com/connectors/custom-connectors/paconn-cli))

## Connection setup
