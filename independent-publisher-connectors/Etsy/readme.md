#### Update a listing's variation images

#### Upload a listing file
Uploads a new file for a digital listing, or associates an existing file with a specific listing.

Associating an existing file to a physical listing converts the physical listing into a digital listing, which removes all shipping costs and any product and inventory variations.

#### Upload a listing image
Uploads or assigns an image to a listing identified by a shop ID with a listing ID. To upload a new image, set the image file as the value for the image parameter. You can assign a previously deleted image to a listing using the deleted image's image ID in the listing image ID parameter. When a request contains both image and listing image ID parameter values, the endpoint uploads the image in the image parameter only.
