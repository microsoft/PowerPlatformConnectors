## Known Issues and Limitations
The connector does not implement all operations and/or responses from the underlying service. Get in touch, if you find something, that is missing and let us align on how to implement it!

The underlying service currently is completely free, but to be able to provide SLA, might introduce paid plans too. In that scenario, this connector will need a rework too, but notification will be provided on this readme with multiple months ahead.
