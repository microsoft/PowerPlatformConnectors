# CO2 Signal Connector
Get the most recent carbon intensity numbers for any country on the map. CO2 Signal API allows you to get access to information about

* where the electricity in a specific region comes from
* how it was produced
* how much carbon was emitted to produce it

## Pre-requisites

CO2 Signal expects the API key to be included as a header in all requests to the server: 
auth-token: myapitoken

## Known Issues and Limitations
* The API has a rate limit of 30 requests per hour and max 1 request per second. the latter limit means Power Automate users may see 429 errors. 

* This API is free for non-commercial use. [Reach out](mailto://hello@electricitymap.org) to Co2 Signal if you plan to commercialise it.

* Always update this connector via the command line tool. The custom connector UI will report and error with the "Remote Auth Reader" policy because the UI does not allow an empty value. If you save the connector via the custom connector UI, it writes an invalid value to the policy which will stop the Get Zones endpoint from working.
```
paconn create --api-def apiDefinition.swagger.json --api-prop apiProperties.json.
```

* One of the endpoints in this connector calls a different API - the Electricity Market API. Electricitymarket owns the CO2 Signal API and recommend this API in their documentation.
