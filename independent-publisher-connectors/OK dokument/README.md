# Prerequisites
You need to have an account at https://app.okdokument.com and a valid API key generated by the *OK dokument* service.  

# Supported Operations

## 1. Document Upload
Action used for uploading a PDF file to the document signature service. This action takes a base64 string and uploads it to the *OK dokument*  API platform.  

You can choose between two types of operations:  
- tosign  
- preprocessing_tags  

**tosign** document operation uploads a document and prepares the document for electronic signature.  
**preprocessing_tags** document operation will check your document for unique strings `_sig1_, _sig2_, _sig3_, _sig4_, _sig5_`. If these strings exist in your document, *OK dokument* will automatically inserts signature acrofields in the original place of the unique string location.  

## 2. Signature Request
This action is used for generating signature request ID. Within this action you have to use Document ID. The Document ID is a result from Document upload action.  
In this action you can transform your signature process into a multistage signature process. Adding additional parameter "Signature fields" allows you to manage what should be available in each signature request. You can use acrofields with internal names `_sig1_, _sig2_, _sig3_, _sig4_, _sig5_`.  

This action can be used multiple times in your process. Signature request action is generated in *OK dokument* service as "Signature request" and this ID is unique for every "Sign" action. 

To send request for document signature you use response attribute URL and use it in email, push notification or MS Teams to ask someone to sign specific document.

Once document is signed you can use “Signature request” to change the document state to “to sign” and create new signatureRequestId and prepare the document for next signature. Than the process repeats steps 3 – 5.

To disable Sign Anywhere feature you can use parameter Additional rules with value `signAnywhere-false`. This parameter disable Sign Anywhere in signature request.

## 3. Wait for Signature
Trigger action „Wait for Signature“ can be used in your process. „Wait for Signature“ action is waiting till document signature is confirmed in *OK dokument* service by clicking the Submit button. Once signature is submitted this trigger action is completed. You can use this action if you need to wait for document signature confirmation in your process.  

## 4. Download signed document
This action allows you to download signed document and process the document in additional steps in your system or save it to SharePoint or other document storage system.  

## 5. Delete document
Once your document is signed, you can delete the document from *OK dokument* service using action delete manually. All uploaded documents are deleted automatically after 60 days and signed documents are deleted after 10 days.
