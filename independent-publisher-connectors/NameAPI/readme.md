## Known Issues and Limitations

Current version of the connector only supports a subset of the API endpoints. Additonally, the supported operations don't fully map with the available inputs to the API endpoints. Contact me if you see a need to bring in any of the other ones or extend the existing ones!

The underlying API itself has some limitations, mostly based on your subscription: [https://www.nameapi.org/en/account/quotas/](https://www.nameapi.org/en/account/quotas/)
