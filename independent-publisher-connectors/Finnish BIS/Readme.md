# Finnish BIS
This API provides information from the Finnish Business Information System (BIS) maintained by the PRH and the Finnish Tax Administration. Data are available about the following company or business types: limited liability companies, public limited companies, housing companies, co-operatives, insurance companies, or public insurance companies. In addition to basic details of businesses or companies registered at the Finnish Trade Register, the service also provides information on other registers they have been added to: the Prepayment Register, the Employer Register, the VAT Register, the register of bodies liable for tax on insurance premiums, and the Client Register of the Tax Administration.

The BIS Search also provides information on entities which are not registered at the Finnish Trade Register, such as municipalities or Government agencies in Finland.
