# OpenNEM Connector
The OpenNEM project aims to make the wealth of public National Electricity Market (NEM) data more accessible to a wider audience.

We hope that improved access will facilitate better public understanding of the market, improve energy literacy and help facilitate a more informed national discussion on Australiaâ€™s energy transition in the long term interests of consumers. By providing a clear window on the data, we hope to address the information asymmetry between stakeholders and improve the productivity of those engaged in energy market discussions..
