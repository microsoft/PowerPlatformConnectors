## Prerequisites
A paid or trial HubSpot account.

## Obtaining Credentials
A HubSpot account (trial or paid) is needed for API key access. The API key is specific to a HubSpot account, not each user, and only one key is allowed at a time. The key can be found in Account Settings > Account Setup > Integrations > API Keys. More information can be found [here](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/integrations/how-do-i-get-my-hubspot-api-key).

A free HubSpot developer account is needed to install an OAuth app in your account for OAuth 2.0 access. Installed apps can be found in Account Settings > Account Setup > Integrations > Connected Apps. More information can be found [here](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/working-with-oauth).
