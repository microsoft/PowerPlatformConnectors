# Hunter
Hunter lets you find professional email addresses in seconds and connect with the people that matter for your business. At Hunter, we consider data to be most valuable when sourced and processed using transparent methods. Every single email address we collect and distribute in the Domain Search has public sources we indicate along with the discovery dates.
