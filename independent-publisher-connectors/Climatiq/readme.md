# Climatiq
Climatiq helps you calculate the environmental footprint created by a broad range of emission-generating activities. We simplify the process of converting your operational activity data into CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) estimates, allowing you to understand your impact on the environment and identify actions to manage and reduce it.

## Prerequisites
You will need an account with [Climatiq](https://app.climatiq.io/).

## Obtaining Credentials
Once you log into your account, find the Get API Keys section of your Dashboard or Resources. You can use either the autogenerated key for your account or create a new API key.

## Supported Operations
### Estimate emissions
Calculate total estimated emissions produced for a particular activity, in kgCO2e, using the available emission factors.
### Batch estimations
Batch estimations can be used to calculate multiple emission estimations in a single request. Currently limited to maximum 100 operations per request.
### Calculate travel flight emissions
Calculate total estimated emissions produced by passenger flights between the specified airports.
### Calculate freight flight emissions
Calculate total estimated emissions produced by freight flights between the specified airports.
### Get computing metadata
Returns metadata, such as what sort of providers and regions are available for the different computing endpoints.
### Calculate CPU emissions
Calculate total estimated emissions based on the usage for a set number of virtual CPU's (vCPUs).
### Get storage emissions
Calculate total estimated emissions based on storing data for a set amount of time.
### Get memory emissions
Calculate total estimated emissions based on having memory (RAM) available for a set amount of time.
### Calculate emission based on classification
Calculate total estimated emissions produced for a particular activity, as described by an industry classification scheme such as ISIC or NACE.
### Calculate custom activity emissions
Calculate total estimated emissions produced for a particular activity in kgCO2e using a custom activity that you have defined under the Activity Mapping tab inside your Climatiq Dashboard.
### Batch custom activity estimations
Batch estimations for custom activities work like regular Batch Estimates, allowing you to calculate multiple emission estimations in a single request, all based on custom activities mapped in the Climatiq Dashboard. Currently limited to maximum 100 operations per request.
### Search emission factors
Allows you to determine what emission factors are available to be used in your estimates.
### Get sources
Climatiq aggregates several different sources for the same emission factors, as different organizations often come to different conclusions about how much an activity emits. This action returns a list of sources available for a given query.
### Get years
Not all emission factors have data for all years. This action returns a list of years available for a given query.
### Get regions
Not all emission factors have data for all geographic regions. This action returns a list of regions available for a given query.
### Get categories
Returns a list of categories available for a given query.
### Get sectors
Returns a list of sectors available for a given query.
### Get life cycle activities
Returns a list of life cycle assessment(LCA) activities available for a given query.
### Get unit types
Returns a list of unit types available for a given query.

## Known Issues and Limitations
