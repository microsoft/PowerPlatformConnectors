# Square
Square helps millions of sellers run their business - from secure credit card processing to point of sale solutions.

## Publisher: Troy Taylor

## Prerequisites
Use of this connector will require permission from the owner of a seller account for production use with OAuth 2. You should also sign up for a [Square Developer account](https://developer.squareup.com/us/en) to gain access to a sandbox environment, also using OAuth 2.

## Obtaining Credentials
In your Square Developer account, you will need to create an application registration to be granted a sandbox OAuth 2 application ID and access token. You will also need to set the OAuth redirect URL to https://global.consent.azure-apim.net/redirect. Once you are ready to use the connector in production, the owner will need to register a production application with the same redirect URL.
