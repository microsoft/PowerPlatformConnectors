# WhatIsMyBrowser
The WhatIsMyBrowser.com service provides an easy way for your website or system to get detailed information about the technology that your visitors are using to browse your website. There are lots of uses for it, but some of the most popular ones include using this information to personalize the content and advertising on your site for each visitor, help identify "strange" or risky activity on your site, and to gather general demographic information about the visitors to your site.
