# LoginLlama
LoginLlama adds an extra layer of customer security without the extra work. LoginLlama uses a number of ranking factors to decide if a login is deemed suspicious. We determine a score for each login based on how 'suspicious' it is. We then use Bollinger Bands to determine if the login is suspicious or not.
