# Welcome to the Independent Publisher Connector Directory!

The ```independent-publisher-connectors``` folder contains connectors that are submitted by publishers that do not own the underlying service behind their connector. 
Anyone can submit a new connector to this folder, add functionality to connectors in this folder, and resolve issues related to the connectors in this folder. The folder 
is managed by the Independent Publisher Connector Community, which includes Independent Publishers and Project Coordinators. The master branch is maintained by the Microsoft 
Connector Certification Team, who ensures that the connector version is identical to that deployed in the Power Platform. The dev branch is maintained by the connector
maintainer(s) and the Microsoft Connector Certification Team to allow community development of the connector prior to certification and deployment of a version.

## Best Practices for Submission
- You can only submit one connector per PR. This ensures that our validation process runs smoothly.
- Please add an email to the support email section. This is in case we need to reach out to you! 
- Please make sure to fill in the privacy policy parameter with the privacy policy for the end service.
- Please make sure that your operation descriptions are detailed. This ensures that the user can understand your operation.

## Contributing to this Directory

1. Create a fork to the ```independent-publisher-connectors directory``` and create your connector in the fork.

2. Submit a pull request to the ```dev``` branch. Ensure that the following files are included: apiProperities.json, apiDefinition.swagger.json, and readme.md. You can find a sample of a readme.md file [here](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPlatformConnectors/blob/dev/custom-connectors/AzureKeyVault/Readme.md). Fill out the checkbox to acknowledge that you’ve tested this connector.

3. Validation processes: The swagger verification and breaking change validation process will automatically run and leave comments. Please address any requested changes by updating the connector.

4. Once you’ve pushed all necessary changes, the Certification Team will trigger the certification process to run automatically. The script will confirm that either the process has started or that there is an error. If there’s an error, the certification team will leave a comment. Please address this comment.

5. Certification team will release your connector to the testing region and ask you to test your connector. Once you've tested your connector in a preview environment, resolve the comment. Please view our documentation on testing [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/certification-testing). 

6. Microsoft Certification team will release your connector to production and a script will sync dev and master branches.

7. Your GitHub handle will be added to the CODEOWNER file to give you access to submitting PRs directly without having to clone in the future and you will be able to accept changes from other publishers.

## Important Information from the Independent Publisher Connector Manifesto

1. You become an Independent Publisher by submitting a new Independent Publisher connector or by contributing sufficient functionality to an existing Independent Publisher connector. As an Independent Publisher, you agree to maintaining that connector by resolving issues and being listed as one of the “code owners.” As a result, there can be more than one Independent Publisher for each Independent Publisher connector.

2. By adding functionality to an existing Independent Publisher connector without becoming an official Independent Publisher, solving an issue for an Independent Publisher connector, and presenting on an Independent Publisher community call, you are considered an Independent Publisher contributor.

3. It is important to reduce connector duplicates across the Power Platform to reduce the flow and app maker confusion. If a Certified connector or Independent Publisher connector to an end service already exists, it is highly recommended that those changes are submitted to the original Certified or Independent Publisher connector. In cases where the end service has a wide variety of endpoint types and functionality, you can submit an Independent Publisher connector to that service with a more specific name. For example, HubSpot is split up into Marketing, CRM, and CMS.

4. Microsoft doesn’t expect Independent Publishers to understand terms and conditions or other issues that may arise. As a result, Microsoft doesn’t have an obligation to publish your connector to the product. If Microsoft or the Independent Publisher Connector Group receive a complaint from the end service owner, Microsoft reserves the right to remove it from the Power Platform. Microsoft encourages publishers to submit Independent Publisher connectors to end services that we currently do not support to alleviate the risks of the connector having to be removed.

5. If an end service owner reaches out to Microsoft or the Independent Publisher Connector Group and requests that they want ownership of the Independent Publisher connector that connects to their end service, Microsoft reserves the right to provide them with maintainer rights.
