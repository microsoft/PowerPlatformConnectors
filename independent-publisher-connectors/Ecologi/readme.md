# Ecologi
Ecologi is a platform to reverse and halt climate change. We facilitate the funding of climate projects and tree planting projects around the world, allowing ordinary people to contribute to real climate action. Our mission is to remove 50% of global CO2 emissions by 2040 and to responsibly plant billions of trees every year.
