## Known Issues and Limitations
To ensure a consistent developer experience for all API users, the Notion API is rate limited and basic size limits apply to request parameters.

### Rate Limit
* Rate-limited requests will return a "rate_limited" error code (HTTP response status 429).
* The rate limit for incoming requests is an average of 3 requests per second. Some bursts beyond the average rate are allowed.
* Integrations should accommodate variable rate limits by handling HTTP 429 responses and backing off (or slowing down) the speed of future requests.
* A common way to implement this is using one or several queues for pending requests, which can be consumed by sending requests as long as Notion does not respond with an HTTP 429.

### Size limits
Notion limits the size of certain parameters, and the depth of children in requests.
* A requests that exceeds any of these limits will return "validation_error" error.
* In addition to the property limits given, payloads have a maximum size of 1000 block elements and 500kb.

### Request size limits

These limits apply to requests sent to Notion's API only. There are different limits on the number of relations and people mentions returned by the API.
