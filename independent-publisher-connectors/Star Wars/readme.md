## Known Issues and Limitations

Swapi has rate limiting to prevent malicious abuse (as if anyone would abuse Star Wars data!) and to make sure our service can handle a potentially large amount of traffic. Rate limiting is done via IP address and is currently limited to 10,000 API request per day. This is enough to request all the data on the website at least ten times over. There should be no reason for hitting the rate limit..
