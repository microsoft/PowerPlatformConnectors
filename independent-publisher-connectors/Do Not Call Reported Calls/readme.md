# Do Not Call Reported Calls
The Do Not Call (DNC) Reported Calls Data API endpoint provides data every weekday about Do Not Call and robocall complaints reported to the Federal Trade Commission. This data consists of information reported by consumers, including the telephone number originating the unwanted call, the date the complaint was created, the time the call was made, the consumerâ€™s city and state locations reported, the subject of the call, and whether the call was a robocall. None of the information about the reported calls is verified. This data is typically updated each weekday by about noon Eastern time. Weekend data is updated on Monday and holiday data is updated on the next business day.
