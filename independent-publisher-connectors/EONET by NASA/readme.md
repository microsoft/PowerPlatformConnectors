# EONET by NASA
The Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker (EONET) is a prototype web service from NASA with the goal of:

- Providing a curated source of continuously updated natural event metadata.
- Providing a service that links those natural events to thematically-related web service-enabled image sources (e.g., via WMS, WMTS, etc.).
