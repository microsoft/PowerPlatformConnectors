# Xero Accounting
The Xero accounting software uses a single unified ledger, which allows users to work in the same set of books regardless of location or operating system. Its features include automatic bank feeds, invoicing, accounts payable, expense claims, fixed asset depreciation, purchase orders, bank reconciliations, and standard business and management reporting.

## Publisher: Hitachi Solutions

## Prerequisites
To use this connector, you need the following

- A Microsoft Power Apps or Power Automate plan with custom connector feature
- A Xero account with either the demo company or a paid subscription tenant
- A Xero developer account with a configured OAuth 2.0 application

## Obtaining Credentials
After signing in at [developer.xero.com](https://developer.xero.com/), navigate to the My Apps section and create a new app. Give it a descriptive name and choose Web App as the integration type. Enter your company URL and for the OAuth 2.0 redirect URIs field, use `https://global.consent.azure-apim.net/redirect`. Agree to the terms and conditions and create the app. Copy the client ID created and then generate and copy the client secret - these will be used when configuring the custom connector. If you are going to build triggers for your Xero tenant, that configuration is on the Webhooks tab in this app. Since Xero allows for triggers based on contacts and invoices but only allows one URL per app, best practice is to create a second app to trigger the second object changes.

## Getting Started
Follow the guide provided by Xero on [developer.xero.com](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/getting-started/getting-started-guide). 
### Getting Started with Xero App webhooks
Currently, there is no API available that allows this custom connector to create triggers for flows. Start by creating a new Power Automate cloud flow using the 'When a HTTP request is received' trigger.

After you save the flow, an Azure HTTP POST URL will be created and you will use this with your Xero app webhook. You will then have to use the Xero My Apps UI to [create the webhook(s)](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/webhooks/creating-webhooks).

As there is only one notification URL allowed per app, to receive notifications about the second object you will need to create a second app.
