
## AIHY My Hospitals Connector
The My Hospitals API currently allows you to search for specific data across the MyHospitals national hospital reporting platform. This data provides information about your local hospital, hospitals within your region, state or territory and nationally.

To avoid the need for programming, the API also returns some data in machine readable CSV format and/or XLSX format.

You can see what information is available from the API, and how you can filter and search for specific information, by exploring the [interactive home page](https://myhospitalsapi.aihw.gov.au/).

## Prerequisites
You will need the following to proceed
* A Microsoft Power Apps or Power Automate plan with custom connector feature
* The Power platform CLI tools

## Publisher: Paul Culmsee

## Building the connector 
The API is an open read-only API and requires no authentication. This will be reviewed regularly and, depending on usage, an API key system may be implemented.

## Supported Operations
The connector supports the following operations
### Get Flat Formatted Data 
Gets formatted data in a flattened structure with each item corresponding to a single data point. Data is restricted to within a single measure category and can be optionally filtered by measure, reporting unit code, reporting unit type and reporting dates. Matching within each filter is by logical disjunction (OR) and matching across filters is by logical conjunction (AND). NOTE: There is currently a pagination restriction on this query that restricts requests to a maximum of 1000 results. Use skip and top to control this pagination. Sorting is not currently available
