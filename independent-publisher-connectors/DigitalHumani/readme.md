# DigitalHumani
DigitalHumani - A RaaS (Reforestation as a Service) which easily integrates with your products to reforest the planet. It is developed and maintained by a group of volunteers who want to make their part to help fight climate change. The $1 / tree is paid directly to the reforestation organization you choose, without us handling the money. This way, you can be sure that the money will be used to have the trees planted.
