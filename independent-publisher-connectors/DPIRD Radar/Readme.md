## Known Issues and Limitations
* The API Key is provided free of charge but is non-transferable and must only be used by the individual or entity to which the API Key has been issued (the API User).

* An API User may be subject to a limit on the number of free API calls it is permitted to make per day or per month. DPIRD will notify the API User through its Nominated User of any limits applicable to an API Userâ€™s DPIRD User Account.

* Whilst the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development make every effort to provide accurate data in a timely fashion, we are not able to guarantee the availability of data at all times.

* Due to remoteness and harsh environments the weather stations may be submitted to, there are times when we may not receive any data. In future we will attempt to derive some of the missing data.
