# Rebrickable
Rebrickable will help you find which LEGO sets you can build from the sets and parts you already own. Every MOC on Rebrickable has a list of parts and building instructions, so you can be sure that anything you find here is buildable! You may not have every part required, but the beauty of LEGO is that you are encouraged to improvise!
