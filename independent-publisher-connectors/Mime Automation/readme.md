# Mime Automation
The Mime Automation connector helps you to extract attachments in a Base-64 formated string together with its file name, which is originating from a Base-64-encoded TNEF file string.

## Prerequisites
Required. Any plans or licenses, tools required from the connector.â€‹

## Supported Operations
### Extract files from a TNEF-encoded file
For the "Content" parameter you need to provide a Base64-encoded TNEF file string.
The API service will then extract existing files in an JSON array with file name and content parameters.
The content will also be a base-64 encoded string of the actual file.

## Obtaining Credentials
Please go this web site and subscribe to the required plan:
https://www.accloudsolutions.com/products/apis/tnef-attachment-extractor

Once you have signed up and subscribed to a plan you will get an API key in your portal overview.

When you use this connector you need to provide that API key for the connection to be configured.

## Getting Started
Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format or TNEF is a proprietary email attachment format used by Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Exchange Server. An attached file with TNEF encoding is most often named winmail.dat or win.dat, and has a MIME type of Application/MS-TNEF. The official (IANA) media type, however, is application/vnd.ms-tnef.

This API endpoint expects in the request body a JSON with a "content" property

{
    content: "BASE-64 encoded string of a TNEF file"
}

For quick testing you can convert your winmail.dat (TNEF encoded file) into a base-64 encoded string with online converter:

https://base64.guru/converter/encode/file

Otherwise you need to implement this conversion logic in your client prior to calling this API endpoint.

As a result this endpoint will return base-64 encoded files and its original file names.

The result schema will be like this:

{
    fileName:"mypicture.jpg"
    content:"/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAgAAZABkAAD/7AARRHVja3kAAQAEAAAAPAAA/+4AJkFkb2JlAGTAAAAAAQMAFQQDBgoNAAADiAAABUwAAAfnAAALd//bAI...",

    fileName:"readme.txt"
    content:"/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAgAAZABkAAD/7AARRHVja3kAAQAEAAAAPAAA/+4AJkFkb2JlAGTAAAAAAQMAFQQDBgoNAAADiAAABUwAAAfnAAALd//bAI..."
}

To quickly check and convert the result base-64 strings back you could also use this online converter tool:

Use case:

Some email clients or third party applications that receive emails cannot interpret the TNEF-encoded file that comes from users that are using Microsoft Outlook as their main email client to send their emails with having the TNEF feature activated. With a custom implementation /business process flow that is using our API it would be still possible to parse out and extract the attachted documents in order to store these files on your client or in your third party application.
