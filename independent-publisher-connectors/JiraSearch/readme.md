# Jira Search Api
Jira Software is part of a family of products designed to help teams of all types manage work. Originally, Jira was designed as a bug and issue tracker. But today, Jira has evolved into a powerful work management tool for all kinds of use cases, from requirements and test case management to agile software development. This connector provides access to the v2 Jira issue search API which is not exposed using the built-in JIRA connector.
