* `Topics Extraction`: Topics Extraction extracts relevant information such as Named Entities (people, locations, organizations, etc), concepts as well as facts (dates, time expressions, quantities, etc) from bodies of text.
* `Text Classification`: Text Classification classifies texts based on a hierarchical categorization or taxonomy.
* `Sentiment Analysis`: Sentiment Analysis analyzes texts and detects their polarity, subjectivity, irony and emotional agreement.
* `Language Identification`: Language Identification automatically detects the language of texts obtained from any source.
* `Corporate Reputation`: This API provides a semantic tagging of multilingual content for the purpose of Corporate Reputation analysis.
